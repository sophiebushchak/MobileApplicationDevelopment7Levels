# 7 Levels of Android Mobile Development Assignments
This repository contains assignments done for the "Mobile Application Development" course at the Hogeschool van Amsterdam/Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences.
There are 7 levels of 3 applications each that were made. The purpose behind these applications was to learn Android development with Kotlin and the Android Studio IDE.
The most interesting applications to look at would be the Task 2 assignments for each level, as these were made with zero guidance except for some feature requirements and a specification for what the UI should look like.

## Structure

The repository is structured into two folders. The "Practice Assignments" folder contains all the assignments done with assistance in class or with a written guide from the professors. The "Solo Assignments" folder is the most interesting part of the repository as it contains assignments that were done alone without guidance, only using the practice assignments as a reference for the theory.
